### Type I 

$\alpha$ - P("False positive/False alarm"). That is $H_0$ is true( no significance), but $H_0$ is rejected.  Other in other words, the probability of telling you things are wrong, given that **things are correct.** 

### Type II

$\beta$ - P("False negative"). That is $H_1$ is true(significance), but $H_0$ is not rejected. In other words, the probability of telling you thing are correct, given that **things are wrong.**  

### Critical value

If the critical value is increased to reduce Type I error, the Type II error will increase. If she reduces the critical value to reduce the Type II error, the Type I error will increase. 

### The sample size

By increasing the sample size of each group, both Type I and Type II errors will be reduces.  

### Power

Power is the probability of rejecting $H_0$ when $H_1$ is true (correct conclusion). It is the power to detect change (significance).
